# Hi there! I'm Jayden! You might know me as ddozzi ðŸ‘‹

* I'm a programmer, gamer, and student 
* Java, Python, R and C# programmer. In the process of learning web development.

## About me
I'm a terrible programmer that works mostly with backend things using languages such as Java, Python etc. and databases using MySQL and MongoDB.
I've also had some experience in working with large datasets and machine learning, though i quit after a while -- but i'm in the process of 
getting back into it. I'm also learning a bit of web-development, and can currently create fairly responsive pages.

## Stuff i've worked and working on
* Created third party modifications for popular game; Minecraft
* Head developer @ Agility
* Mixin client tutorial
* Was a UI & UX designer for a while
* Created some games, none of which i've finished (got bored of making them)
* Head developer @ Space (retired)
* Created Minecraft modding tutorials
* Used machine learning for cancer detection or something (idk man, it's been a while)
* a lot more...

that's pretty much it, dont know what else to put here
